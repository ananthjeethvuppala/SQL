# 🗄️ SQL Practice and Problem-Solving

This repository contains my SQL practice files and solutions to various SQL problems, including challenges from **LeetCode**.  
The goal is to apply SQL concepts in practical scenarios, strengthen problem-solving skills, and build a portfolio of clean, optimized queries.  
All exercises and projects in this repository were implemented using **MySQL**.

## 📌 Skills Applied
- **Database Design (MySQL)** – Creating databases, tables, and defining relationships  
- **Data Manipulation** – Using `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` commands  
- **Data Retrieval** – Writing complex `SELECT` queries with filtering, sorting, and grouping  
- **Joins & Relationships** – Implementing `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`  
- **Aggregations & Analysis** – Using `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`  
- **Advanced Queries** – Subqueries, CTEs, and Window Functions  
- **Performance Optimization** – Writing efficient queries with indexes and proper query structure
